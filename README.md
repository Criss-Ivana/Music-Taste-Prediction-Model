## Overview

This project uses a simple machine learning model to predict music taste based on age and gender. The model is trained, loaded, and evaluated in a single Jupyter Notebook file.

## Project Structure

1. Training the Model: The model is trained using a dataset containing age, gender, and music preferences.

2. Loading the Model: After training, the model is saved and can be loaded to make predictions.

3. Decision Tree Visualization: A decision tree is displayed to visualize how the model classifies.
